        <h2>Structure of Governance</h2>
        <p>The United Communist Democratic States operates under a unique governmental structure designed to ensure both efficient leadership and broad citizen participation. Our system is built upon three primary branches, working in concert to uphold our principles and serve the populace.</p>

        <h3>The Executive Branch</h3>
        <p>Led by the **President**, the Executive Branch is responsible for the daily administration of the micronation, implementation of policies, and representing UCDS on the global stage. The President acts as the head of state and government, ensuring the smooth functioning of all national services.</p>
        <p><strong>Current President:</strong> Desert Eagle</p>
        <p>The Executive Branch also includes various ministerial positions responsible for specific portfolios such as foreign affairs, internal security, and resource management.</p>

        <h3>The Legislative Branch</h3>
        <p>The Legislative Branch, known as the **People's Council**, is composed of elected representatives from across UCDS. Its primary function is to deliberate on and enact laws, approve national policies, and ensure that the government remains accountable to the citizens. All major decisions are subject to public debate and democratic vote within the Council.</p>

        <h3>The Judicial Branch</h3>
        <p>The Judicial Branch is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring justice within UCDS. It is an independent body committed to fairness, equality, and upholding the rights and responsibilities of all citizens under the national charter. Details regarding specific judicial bodies are in development.</p>

        <h2>Founding Figure</h2>
        <p>While the government operates through its established branches, the wisdom and vision of the **Founder, kingstondino**, continue to guide the nation's long-term trajectory and foundational principles.</p>
