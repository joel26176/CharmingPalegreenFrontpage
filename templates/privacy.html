        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The United Communist Democratic States (UCDS) is committed to protecting the privacy of its website visitors. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your data. By using this website, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you visit the UCDS official website, we automatically collect certain information about your device and Browse activity. This information is collected solely for the purposes of website security, analysis of traffic patterns, and internal administration. The primary data collected includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is logged when you access any page on our website. This is used to identify potential security threats, analyze geographical traffic distribution, and manage access.</li>
            <li><strong>Timestamp:</strong> The precise time and date of your visit are recorded alongside your IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Pages Visited:</strong> We log which pages of the website are accessed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Security:</strong> IP addresses are checked against a "flagged IP list" to identify and mitigate potential malicious activity, unauthorized access attempts, or attacks on our infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Analysis:</strong> Aggregated, anonymized data (not directly linked to individual IPs) may be used to understand website usage patterns, popular pages, and overall traffic volume to improve user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Administration:</strong> The logged data is accessible to authorized UCDS administrators for security monitoring and operational purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>The UCDS does not share, sell, rent, or trade your IP addresses or any other collected personal information with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, subpoena, or governmental request to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection of UCDS:</strong> To protect the rights, property, or safety of the United Communist Democratic States, its citizens, or others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the collected data. Access to IP logs and flagged lists is restricted to authorized UCDS administrators via a secure login system. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>IP addresses and associated timestamps are retained for a period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, typically for security analysis and to track recurring patterns. Once this period expires, the data is periodically reviewed and securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>As a visitor, you acknowledge the collection of your IP address as described herein for the purposes of website security and administration. For specific privacy concerns or questions regarding your data, please contact us using the information below.</p>
