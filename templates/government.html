        <h2>The Government of the UCDS</h2>
        <p>The United Communist Democratic States operates under a unique system of governance designed to ensure both efficient administration and robust democratic participation.</p>

        <h3>The Workers' Council</h3>
        <p>The primary legislative body, the Workers' Council, is composed of directly elected representatives from every industrial and agricultural collective, as well as delegates from vital public services. Its members are mandated to represent the interests of their respective sectors and the broader working class, ensuring that all legislation directly serves the collective good.</p>

        <h3>The People's Presidium</h3>
        <p>Serving as the executive branch, the People's Presidium is a collective leadership body elected by the Workers' Council. It is responsible for implementing legislation, overseeing government departments, and managing the day-to-day affairs of the nation. The Presidium operates on principles of collective decision-making and accountability to the Council.</p>

        <h3>The Supreme People's Tribunal</h3>
        <p>Justice in the UCDS is administered by the Supreme People's Tribunal and its network of local and regional courts. The judiciary is independent and tasked with upholding the Constitution and laws of the UCDS, ensuring fairness, and resolving disputes in accordance with socialist principles.</p>

        <h3>Direct Citizen Participation</h3>
        <p>Beyond representation, the UCDS places a strong emphasis on direct citizen participation. Local communes hold regular assemblies for direct democratic decision-making on community matters, and national referendums are held on critical issues to ensure the will of the people is directly expressed.</p>
        <p>Every citizen is encouraged to engage in the political process, contribute to public discourse, and actively participate in the building of a more perfect society.</p>
