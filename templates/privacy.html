        <p>The United Communist Democratic States is committed to protecting the privacy and data of its visitors and citizens. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information on our official website.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visitor IP Addresses:</strong> We log the IP addresses of visitors to our website for security purposes (e.g., detecting and mitigating malicious activity) and for general, non-identifiable analytics (e.g., geographic distribution of visitors). This data is not used to identify individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizenship Application Data:</strong> When you submit a citizenship application, we collect the information voluntarily provided by you, including your full name, email address, Discord username (optional), your reason for applying, and the IP address from which the application was submitted. This information is collected solely for the purpose of processing your application.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cookies or Tracking:</strong> This website does not use cookies for tracking or any other purpose. We do not employ third-party analytics services that track user behavior across websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Logs:</strong> IP addresses are used for website security, troubleshooting, and to identify potential misuse or threats. They are not shared with third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizenship Applications:</strong> The data provided in citizenship applications is used by authorized UCDS officials to review and process your application. Your Discord username may be used to contact you regarding your application if necessary. Your IP address submitted with the application may be reviewed in conjunction with IP logs for security vetting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>

            <li>All collected data is stored securely on UCDS servers (or within the secure environment of our hosting provider).</li>
            <li>Access to citizenship application data is restricted to authorized UCDS officials only.</li>
            <li>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>IP logs are retained for a limited period necessary for security analysis, typically 30-90 days, after which they are anonymized or deleted.</li>
            <li>Citizenship application data (including approved and denied applications) is retained for record-keeping purposes in accordance with UCDS administrative protocols.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>

            <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you (specifically for citizenship applications).</li>
            <li>Request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your citizenship application data, subject to UCDS record-keeping policies.</li>
        </ul>
