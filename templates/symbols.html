        <h2>The National Flag</h2>

                <li><strong>Gold/Yellow:</strong> Symbolizes prosperity, enlightenment, and the rich potential of our nation.</li>
                <li><strong>[Other elements, e.g., a specific symbol]:</strong> [Explain the meaning of any central emblem or stars, e.g., "A stylized gear represents industry and cooperation," or "A single star signifies national unity and aspiration."]</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>"Ode to the People's Will"</h3>
            <p>
                (Verse 1)<br>
                From humble start, our vision clear and bright,<br>
                A people's voice, uniting in the light.<br>
                For common good, our future we define,<br>
                In UCDS, true freedom's star shall shine.
            </p>

                (Chorus)<br>
                Ode to the People's Will, our anthem strong and free,<br>
                For unity and liberty, UCDS for thee!<br>
                Through struggle, growth, and wisdom's steady hand,<br>

                No dark ages bind, no tyranny shall stand,<br>
                With honest hearts, we build a promised land.<br>
                Each voice is heard, each effort finds its place,<br>
                Progress our guide, with dignity and grace.
            </p>
